What happens during a home inspection? Today I’m at a home inspection for a property that I recently sold to one of my buyers. Joining me is Nick from Homeside Inspections to share his expert insights about the topic.

According to Nick, **one of the most commonly found issues in home inspections is grading issues on the outside**. Whether it's a new construction or a 150-year-old house, soil settles over time. This is typically a minor issue that will likely become a fun project people get to enjoy working on in the warm weather.

Also, during a home inspection, the inspector usually touches everything. From the outside of the property, they check for grading issues, foundation issues, siding issues, etc. When it comes to the inside, they will typically check the windows, electrical outlets, floors, plumbings, appliances, furnaces, and many other things. Nick will also be doing a radon test and a sewer line inspection for today’s home inspection.

Once that’s all done, a report will be sent detailing any issues within the home. I will then review it with the buyer and check if there’s anything significant we can request the seller to repair or replace. Our focus is mostly on health and safety issues, but we can also negotiate other things after the inspection is completed.

If you have more questions about home inspections or anything related, call or email me. I’d love to be your real estate consultant.
