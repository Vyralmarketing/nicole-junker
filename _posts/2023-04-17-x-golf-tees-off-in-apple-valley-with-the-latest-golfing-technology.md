Today, we are excited to bring you an interview from one of our area’s newest attractions, X-Golf! Have you been yet? It is very exciting to have them here, so today we are going to tell you all about them.&nbsp;

They have only been open for a couple of weeks now, and **they have five other locations in the metro area, but this is their biggest one yet.** They are busiest on the weekends but are open seven days a week.&nbsp;

This location has nine simulators, a full bar, and a room with fun games like a dartboard and a pool table. In addition, **they offer golf lessons, which you can [sign up for on their website](https://playxgolf.com/locations/apple-valley/).**&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone call or email. Plus, we are always here for your real estate needs! We hope to hear from you soon.
