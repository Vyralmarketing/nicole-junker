As we begin 2023, I want to share with you my yearly market wrap-up\! At the beginning of 2022, the 13-county metro area had an average sales price of $369,000 with an average of 27 days on market and a list-to-sales price ratio of 102%. That means that almost every home was selling over list price; in most areas of the Twin Cities, there was less than one month of inventory.&nbsp;

Over the course of the year, we have seen some significant changes in the market. **Interest rates increased, but have fortunately leveled off a bit, settling around 6% to 6.5%.** The year ended up with an average sales price of $428,000, which is an increase of 8% over the course of the year in home values.&nbsp;

Days on market was very similar to the beginning of 2022 at around 29 days during the winter. This tends to increase a bit during this time of year, and decrease in the spring, so it tends to average out. Recent statistics tell us that homes are selling at around 99% of list price. **Home inspections and seller-paid closing costs are back into market negotiations,** but this may go away again in the spring depending on the competition.

Sales have slowed a bit as we head into winter, which is something to be expected. As for the number of homes on the market, we currently have around two to three months of inventory. Meanwhile, average sales prices have definitely increased throughout the metro.

I sold many homes last year for under $300,000, and it is still possible for a first-time home buyer to find affordable homes. Experts are anticipating that we will have a healthy spring market. If you have a home on your 2023 bucket list, I would love to help you out. If you need anything real estate related, please don't hesitate to call or email me.
