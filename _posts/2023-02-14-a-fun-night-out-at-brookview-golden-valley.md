Are you looking for ideas for a fun night out? Well, I have you covered! I recently had a very fun day at Brookview Golden Valley. Along the golf course of a community center, there is a bar and grill called Three One Six. Plus, they have curling on artificial fields! **All of it was so fun, and I definitely recommend checking it out.**&nbsp;
