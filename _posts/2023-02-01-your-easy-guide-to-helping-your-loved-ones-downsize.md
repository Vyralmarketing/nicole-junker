Do you see your mom, dad, grandpa, or grandma aging and unable to live in their home anymore? Does the task of moving them seem overwhelming and daunting? Although this can seem like a huge task, I'm here to break downsizing down for you and help you along the way.

The first thing you need to do is have a hard conversation. Whatever your reason for suggesting downsizing, be kind and loving. **Allow your loved ones to have dignity.** You may encounter some resistance, but that's normal.&nbsp;

Next, we need to figure out where they're moving to. I have some great services that are free to the consumer that help you find a place to live based on your needs. They will show you which apartments are available, pricing, and location. Go on some tours and find one that feels right for your family member.

Once you know where your family member is going, it's a little easier to know what you can keep, what they'll have room for, and what items will need to be let go of. **If you have an estate sale, hire a company to do the work**; I have a few that I can recommend. During this process, it's okay to move your family member to their new home. Being out of the home when it's sold will help with their transition.&nbsp;

Once the estate sale is done and all the personal belongings are gone, you can choose to clean the home up. Whatever you decide to do will go a long way. I will work alongside you to get bids, bring in contractors, and get all the work done for you.&nbsp;

The final stage of the process is staging and photos. I will work with my stager to give the home a cozy charm and will get your loved one the most possible amount of money for their home.

If you have questions about this process or anything else, please call or email me. I am always willing to help!
