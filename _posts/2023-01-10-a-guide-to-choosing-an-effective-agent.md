How do you choose the Realtor who will list your home? **The No. 1 thing you should look for is experience.** However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that you should work with an agent who has been in the business for the longest amount of time. After all, most Realtors have only ever worked in a seller's market. Chances are they listed a home on the MLS and sold it in a matter of days or even hours; as we go through a shift in the market, your agent has to have tried and true systems to sell your home.&nbsp;

Additionally, pricing your home is both an art and a science, so don't just choose a Realtor that says they can list your home for the highest amount of money. Some agents will do this to get your business. We call it buying the listing. If your home is listed too high, you will need to do price reductions and then you will end up getting significantly less for your home compared to it being priced correctly to begin with.

This is also true for the agent that charges the least amount of commission. Less commission doesn't necessarily mean that you will net more at the end of your sale. **An agent that charges a low fee or a flat rate will often cut corners in the services that they provide.** Make sure you're interviewing multiple agents to determine if their services fit your needs.&nbsp;

Furthermore, you should find an agent that will offer a pre-listing home inspection. This will ensure that your home is market-ready and there are no surprises along the way. Your agent can help you determine what items need fixing based on the results of that inspection.&nbsp;

They should also have a stager do a consultation for you. I do this with all my sellers and I pay for that consultation. If your home is vacant, **consider staging even just a couple rooms in your home**. Also, I continue to see really poor quality photos on the MLS. Cell phone photos won't cut it. Professional photos are the only way to go. This is your only chance to make a great first impression of your home.
