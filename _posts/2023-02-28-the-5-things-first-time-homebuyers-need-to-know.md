Purchasing a home is an exciting experience, but it can also be daunting if you're unfamiliar with the process. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or someone who has done it before, it's always helpful to have a basic understanding of what to expect. Today I'll cover some top things to know about purchasing a home.

**1\. Find a Realtor you trust.** This is one of the most important things you can do when buying a home. Your Realtor will be a wealth of knowledge and will guide you through the entire process. They'll refer you to a lender they know and trust, which can be especially helpful since certain lenders may fit your needs better than others.

**2\. Get pre-approved.** Before you start shopping for your home, it's important to get pre-approved by a lender. This will give you and your Realtor the information you need to start looking at homes. You'll want to know how much you're approved for, but it's even more important to know what you're comfortable with for a monthly mortgage payment. The lender will also talk to you about how much you need for a down payment, and if any special mortgage programs are available that fit your needs.

**3\. Prepare a wish list for your Realtor.** Your Realtor will want to know what your wants and needs are when it comes to your home. Before you meet with them, it's a good idea to prepare a wish list. Having an idea of what you want and need in a home will give your Realtor some direction and help them find homes that match your criteria.

**4\. Be aware of upfront costs.** There are some upfront costs when purchasing a home. If you're purchasing a single-family home, you may want to negotiate a home inspection into your purchase agreement. This can cost between $600 and $1,000, depending on what you have the inspector do. It's also common to do a sewer line inspection and a radon test. The results of these tests can have an impact on the type of repairs that you ask the seller to make before closing.&nbsp;

Another upfront cost is earnest money. It's a percentage of the purchase price written into the purchase agreement as good-faith money. Itâ€™s due at the time of purchase agreement, but it is also refundable depending on the contingencies of your agreement.

**5\. Reach out for help.** Purchasing a home can be a complex process, so don't hesitate to reach out for help if you need it. Your Realtor and lender are there to answer any questions you may have and guide you through the process. They've done it many times before, and they can help you make informed decisions.

If you have any questions about the buying process, contact me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
