I want to share with you three common mistakes to avoid as a homebuyer:

**1\. Not getting preapproved for a mortgage.** One of the most common mistakes that homebuyers make is not getting preapproved for a mortgage. Before you start your house hunt, it's crucial to get preapproved for a mortgage. This step will help you determine what you can afford and what type of loan you qualify for. Keep in mind that there are many types of loans, and you want to make sure you're picking the right one that suits your needs and budget.

**2\. Not considering all the costs of owning a home.** Another mistake many homebuyers make is not considering all the costs of owning a home. Purchasing a house is more than just the down payment and mortgage cost. You also need to think about other expenses, such as earnest money and inspection fees. Additionally, after purchasing a home, there are ongoing expenses to think about, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utility bills. It's important to take all of these costs into account to ensure that you can afford to maintain your home in the long run.

**3\. Not getting a home inspection.** The third mistake to avoid is not getting a professional home inspection before buying a house. A home inspection is a crucial step in the home-buying process because it helps identify underlying issues with the property that may not be visible to the untrained eye. Getting a professional inspection can save you a lot of money in the long run by identifying potential problems before you make a purchase.

Buying a home is a significant investment, and it's essential to avoid common mistakes that can lead to regret down the road. If you need any assistance with your home-buying journey, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to help.
