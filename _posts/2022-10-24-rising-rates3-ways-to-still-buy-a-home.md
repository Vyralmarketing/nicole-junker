How do I buy a home when interest rates are rising? Many clients have reached out to ask me this question recently. In case you don't know, the Federal Reserve recently raised rates by 75 basis points—the largest increase since 1994. There’s even talk that they might go up again before the end of the year.

There's no denying that higher rates make homes less affordable. So what can you do? Fortunately, there are plenty of creative ways to deal with rising interest rates, and I'd like to share three of them with you today:

**1\. Start by paying off your debt little by little.** This will lower your debt-to-income ratio, which is what lenders use to determine your creditworthiness.

**2\. Consider locking in the rate your lender offers**. Rates are expected to continue to rise to combat inflation, but you won't have to worry about that if your rate is already locked in. Just remember that it only makes sense to do this when you're close to closing since they only stay locked for about a month or two.

**3\. Mortgage points help lower interest rates.** Mortgage points are fees you can pay to lower your interest rate that typically cost 1% of your loan. For example, a point on a $200,000 mortgage would cost you about $2,000. This is a great option depending on your situation and how long you're going to be in the home mortgage. Points may also be tax deductible.
